function createTaskCard(task) {

  // might be a prompt? when one clicks the add task button, they should be promted to add info. with that, i will need an event listener for click on the add task button. then in the prompt, i will need several text fields and one field for adding a date. I will need to add a condition for the fields that they cant be blank and upon filling out all the fields i will need to set the cards data in localStorage via setItem. The date bit will be a calendar selection and then based off that selection - this is info for a diferent function - the urgency of completing the task can be represented by a change in color. 

  // It seems i am making the cards with javascript - the general structue for the page is on html but the prompt will be entriely made by JS. This will require appendChild I think.
