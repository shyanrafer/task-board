Another challenging project... For this project, I started by pulling the the available code provided by the school. From there, I mostly copied code from the week five mini project and began trying to figure out how to morph the copied code to befit my project. This is a part I plugged at for about 10 hours before getting help from the TA and later a tutor. In total, I spent about 15 hours on this assignment. All in all, it took the help of the TA and tutor to get me to the finish line. I knew what to do, but it was a matter of where to put it and how exactly to write it. I heavily commented the project for the sake of explaining thoughts and processes plus for future reference.
